The `Box` component is a fundamental building block in the Pearl UI library. It is a highly abstract component that serves as the foundation for all other components in Pearl UI. By default, it renders a [React Native View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) element.

The Box component enhances the development experience by providing the following benefits

1. **Simplified Layout Creation**: The Box component allows developers to create flexible layouts with ease.
2. **Style Prop Support**: It provides a more intuitive way to pass styles via props. For instance, `backgroundColor` can be passed as a prop instead of using [React Stylesheet](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html) or inline styles. Shorthand props are also supported (e.g., `bgColor` instead of `backgroundColor`).
3. **Base for Complex Components**: The Box component can be used as the base component for creating more complex components, replacing the need for `View`. All components in Pearl UI use `Box` as their base.

## Import

```jsx
import { Box } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Box width="100%" height={200} backgroundColor="primary.500" marginBottom="m">
  This is a box
</Box>
```

## Example

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/box" />

## Component Properties

### Supported Style Properties

The `Box` component supports the following style props:

- [backgroundColor](../../core-features/style-props#color-and-background-color) (Note: Only `backgroundColor` props are supported, not the `color` prop)
- [layout](../../core-features/style-props#layout)
- [position](../../core-features/style-props#position)
- [opacity and visibility](../../core-features/style-props#opacity-and-visibility)

- [shadow](../../core-features/style-props#shadow)

### Animation Properties

The `Box` component also supports animation properties from the [Moti](https://moti.fyi/) library, which allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive UI elements. The [useMotiWithStyleProps](../../hooks/useMotiWithStyleProps) hook from the Moti library is utilized to manage these animation properties.

| Property         | Type          | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`           | <t>object</t> | Defines the starting state of the animation.                                      |
| `to`             | <t>object</t> | Defines the ending state of the animation.                                        |
| `transition`     | <t>object</t> | Specifies the type of transition that the animation will use.                     |
| `exitTransition` | <t>object</t> | Determines the transition type that will be used when the component is unmounted. |
| `state`          | <t>object</t> | Manages the overall state of the animation, including the `from` and `to` states. |
