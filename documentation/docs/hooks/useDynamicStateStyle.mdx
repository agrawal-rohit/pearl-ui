The `useDynamicStateStyle` hook is a utility in Pearl UI that allows you to manage a dynamic state and compose extra styling while a component is in a certain state.

## Import

```js
import { useDynamicStateStyle } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Return value

The `useDynamicStateStyle` hook returns the final props of the component with updated styles according to the current state.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use `useDynamicStateStyle` to manage a dynamic state and compose extra styling:

```js
import { useDynamicStateStyle, allStyleFunctions } from "pearl-ui";

const Button = ({ isActive, ...props }) => {
  // Use the hook to transform the props based on the active state
  const transformedProps = useDynamicStateStyle(
    props,
    "_active",
    isActive,
    allStyleFunctions,
    "basic",
    false
  );

  // Render the button with the transformed props
  return <button {...transformedProps}>Click me</button>;
};

const App = () => {
  // Use a state variable to manage the active state
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  // Render the Button and a toggle button to change the active state
  return (
    <div>
      <Button
        isActive={isActive}
        // Specify the styling of the component when the isActive value is true
        _active={{ backgroundColor: "tomato", color: "white" }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => setIsActive(!isActive)}>
        Toggle Active State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the provided example, the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook is utilized within a `Button` component. The purpose of this hook is to dynamically alter the button's background and text colors in response to changes in the `isActive` prop. Specifically, when `isActive` is set to true, the button's background color transitions to blue, and the text color changes to white.

### Focus State

The `useFocusedState` hook, a derivative of the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook, is responsible for managing the focus state of a component. It applies specific styles when the component is in focus. For a more comprehensive understanding, please refer to the [useFocusedState](../hooks/useFocusedState) documentation.

### Disabled State

The `useDisabledState` hook, built using the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook, handles the disabled state of a component. It applies distinct styles when the component is disabled. For additional information, please refer to the [useDisabledState](../hooks/useDisabledState) documentation.

### Pressed State

The `usePressedState` hook, which is created using the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook, manages the pressed state of a component. It applies unique styles when the component is pressed. For more details, please refer to the [usePressedState](../hooks/usePressedState) documentation.

### Invalid State

The `useInvalidState` hook, a product of the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook, controls the invalid state of a component. It applies specific styles when the component is in an invalid state. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the [useInvalidState](../hooks/useInvalidState) documentation.

### Checked State

The `useCheckedState` hook, developed using the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook, manages the checked state of a component. It applies distinct styles when the component is checked. For further details, please refer to the [useCheckedState](../hooks/useCheckedState) documentation.
