title: Dark Mode Support

Pearl UI is equipped with a built-in feature for managing the active color mode in your applications. By default, the majority of the included components are compatible with dark mode.

## Setting the initial color mode

You can specify the color mode of your application upon its first load using the [ThemeProvider](../getting-started/installation#setting-up-the-theme-provider). This component expects an `initialColorMode` prop which can accept the following values:

1. **light**: The application will always start in _light_ mode
2. **dark**: The application will always start in _dark_ mode
3. **system**: The application will start in the mode that matches the color mode of the underlying device.

<br />

```jsx title="App.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

// Import the ThemeProvider component
import { ThemeProvider } from "pearl-ui";

const App = () => {
  return (
    // Wrap your application components with the ThemeProvider
    <ThemeProvider initialColorMode="system">
        // {... other components go here}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

## Retrieving the active color mode

You can access the active color mode using the [useTheme](../../utils/hooks/useTheme) hook.

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-access" />

## Modifying the color mode

The [useTheme](../../utils/hooks/useTheme) hook provides the following functions to change the active color mode.

### Toggling the active mode

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-toggle" />

### Switching to a specific mode

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-switch" />

## Colors specific to color mode

To make any component compatible with dark mode, you need to define how the colors in the component change based on the active color mode. This can be achieved using the following two methods:

### Object syntax

The [color and background color](./style-props#color-and-background-color) style props can optionally accept color mode specific values that are activated based on the active mode.

The following structure is expected when specifying color mode values:

```tsx
type ColorModeColor = {
  light: PearlTheme["palette"];
  dark: PearlTheme["palette"];
};
```

#### Example

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-object-syntax" />

### useColorModeValue

Pearl UI also offers the [useColorModeValue](../../utils/hooks/useColorModeValue) hook that achieves the same result as [the object syntax](#object-syntax).

Here's how you can re-write the example above using the [useColorModeValue](../../utils/hooks/useColorModeValue) hook:

#### Example

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-hook-syntax" />
