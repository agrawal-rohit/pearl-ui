## A Note from the Creator

Hey there! I'm Rohit Agrawal, the creator of Pearl UI. As a serial maker, I've been building web applications using ReactJS for over 6 years. However, when I transitioned from web to mobile development for a new project, I realized that the development experience in React Native lacked the maturity I was used to in the web ecosystem. That's when Pearl UI was born! It's built to provide a faster and more intuitive development experience.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_rohitagrawal_) and [Github](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit) to keep up with Pearl UI and my other projects. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitagrawal9009/).

_(**Just a heads up:** Pearl UI is a relatively new library, and while I strive for perfection, there might be some bugs. I'm quite active in responding to [issues](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/issues) and in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/discussions). So, if you encounter any bugs or have any feature requests, don't hesitate to reach out.)_
