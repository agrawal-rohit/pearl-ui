## A Note from the Creator

Hello! I'm Rohit Agrawal, the creator of Pearl UI. I've spent years building web applications with ReactJS and have become a power user of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) over the last 2 years. When I shifted my focus to mobile development, I found that the React Native environment didn't quite match the productive development experience I was accustomed to. This led me to create Pearl UI, a library designed to emulate the simplicity and efficiency of Chakra UI for React Native developers.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_rohitagrawal_) and [Github](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit) to keep up with Pearl UI and my other projects. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitagrawal9009/).

_(**Just a heads up:** Pearl UI is a relatively new library, and while I strive for perfection, there might be some bugs. I'm quite active in responding to [issues](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/issues) and in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/discussions). So, if you encounter any bugs or have any feature requests, don't hesitate to reach out.)_
