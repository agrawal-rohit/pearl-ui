Pearl UI is designed with extensibility in mind. It allows developers to easily integrate third-party components into the Pearl UI ecosystem. This is achieved through the 'pearl' function, a powerful utility that transforms a third-party component into a Pearl UI-compatible component.

The benefits of this extensibility are numerous:

1. **Flexibility**: Developers are not restricted to using only the components provided by Pearl UI. They can bring in components from other libraries and make them work seamlessly with Pearl UI.
2. **Consistency**: By transforming third-party components into Pearl UI-compatible components, developers can ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire application. All components, whether they are originally from Pearl UI or not, will adhere to the same theming and style props.
3. **Efficiency**: Developers can leverage the power of Pearl UI's theming and style props without having to rewrite third-party components from scratch. This saves time and effort, and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.
4. **Scalability**: As the project grows, developers can easily add more components to the Pearl UI ecosystem. This makes Pearl UI a scalable solution for large projects.

## Examples

### Converting a Basic React Native Component

Pearl UI's `pearl` function can be used to convert a basic React Native component into a Pearl UI-compatible component. This allows the component to leverage Pearl UI's theming and style props. Here's an example of how you can convert a basic `View` component:

```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { pearl } from "pearl-ui";

const PearlView = pearl(View, {
  componentName: "MyView",
  type: "basic",
  animatable: true,
});
```

In this example, `View` is the base component that we are converting into a Pearl UI-compatible component. The `componentName` is set to 'MyView', which is a unique identifier for the component within the theme. The `type` is set to 'basic', indicating that this is a standalone component. The `animatable` flag is set to true, indicating that this component can support animations.

### Converting a Third-Party Component

Pearl UI's `pearl` function can also be used to convert a third-party component into a Pearl UI-compatible component. This allows the component to leverage Pearl UI's theming and style props. Here's an example of how you can convert the `ActionButton` component from the `react-native-action-button` library:

```tsx
import ActionButton from "react-native-action-button";
import {
  pearl,
  MoleculeComponentProps,
  MolecularComponentConfig,
} from "pearl-ui";

type ActionButtonAtoms = {
  button: ButtonProps;
};

const CustomActionButton = ({
  atoms,
}: Omit<
  MoleculeComponentProps<"MyActionButton", ButtonProps, ActionButtonAtoms>,
  "atoms"
> & {
  atoms?: ActionButtonAtoms;
}) => {
  return (
    <ActionButton buttonColor={props.style.backgroundColor} {...atoms.button} />
  );
};

const molecularConfig: MolecularComponentConfig<ActionButtonAtoms> = {
  parts: ["button"],
  baseStyle: {
    button: {
      bgColor: "blue",
    },
  },
  sizes: {
    sm: {
      button: {
        size: 40,
      },
    },
    md: {
      button: {
        size: 50,
      },
    },
    lg: {
      button: {
        size: 60,
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    primary: {
      button: {
        bgColor: "blue",
      },
    },
    secondary: {
      button: {
        bgColor: "green",
      },
    },
  },
  defaults: {
    size: "md",
    variant: "primary",
  },
};

// Add the molecular configuration to the theme
theme.components.MyActionButton = molecularConfig;

const PearlActionButton = pearl<BaseActionButtonProps, "molecule">(
  CustomActionButton,
  {
    componentName: "MyActionButton",
    type: "molecule",
    animatable: true,
  }
);

// The created component can then be used easily in your application
<PearlActionButton size="sm" variant="secondary" bgColor="red" />;
```

In this example, `ActionButton` is the base component that we are converting into a Pearl UI-compatible component. The `componentName` is set to 'MyActionButton', which is a unique identifier for the component within the theme. The `type` is set to 'molecule', indicating that this is a more complex component composed of multiple atoms. The `animatable` flag is set to true, indicating that this component can support animations.
