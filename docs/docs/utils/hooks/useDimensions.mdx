The `useDimensions` hook is a utility in Pearl UI that allows you to get the value of the dimensions context. This hook is particularly useful in components where you need to know the dimensions of the window.

## Import

```js
import { useDimensions } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Return value

The `useDimensions` hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `width`: The current width of the window.
- `height`: The current height of the window.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use `useDimensions` in a component to adjust its layout based on the window's dimensions:

```jsx
import { useDimensions } from "pearl-ui";

function MyComponent() {
  const { width, height } = useDimensions();

  return (
    <div style={{ width: width / 2, height: height / 2 }}>
      I'm a component that adjusts its size based on the window's dimensions!
    </div>
  );
}
```
