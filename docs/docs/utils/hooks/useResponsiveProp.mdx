The `useResponsiveProp` is a custom hook provided by Pearl UI. It is designed to fetch the appropriate value from a [responsive style object](../../overview/core-features/responsivity) based on the current screen size. This allows for dynamic styling that adapts to different device screens.

## Import

```js
import { useResponsiveProp } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Return value

The `useResponsiveProp` hook returns the value that corresponds to the [breakpoint](../../overview/theming/default-theme#breakpoints) of the active device. This means it will return the value that matches the current screen size.

## Usage

```js
const responsiveWidth = useResponsiveProp({
  phone: "100%",
  tablet: "50%",
  largeTablet: 300,
});
```

In the example above, the `responsiveWidth` will be "100%" on phones, "50%" on tablets, and "300" on large tablets.
