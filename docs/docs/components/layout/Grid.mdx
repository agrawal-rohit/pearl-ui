The `Grid` component is a layout utility in the Pearl UI library. It arranges its children into rows and columns, giving each child an equal amount of space. By default, it renders a [Box](./box) element, which is a fundamental building block in Pearl UI.

:::info
For rendering a large number of items in a grid, it's better to use a virtualized component like a [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) instead of the `Grid` component. Virtualized components only render items that are currently visible on the screen, which can significantly improve performance for large lists.
:::

## Import

```jsx
import { Grid } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Grid numCols={3} spacing="4">
  <Box>Item 1</Box>
  <Box>Item 2</Box>
  <Box>Item 3</Box>
</Grid>
```

### Changing the spacing for columns and rows

You can change the spacing between columns and rows using the `spacingX` and `spacingY` props respectively. Here is an example:

```jsx
<Grid numCols={3} spacingX="2" spacingY="4">
  <Box>Item 1</Box>
  <Box>Item 2</Box>
  <Box>Item 3</Box>
</Grid>
```

This will create a grid with 3 columns, 2 units of spacing between columns, and 4 units of spacing between rows.

## Example

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/grid" />

## Component Properties

### Supported Style Properties

The `Grid` component is built upon the [Box](./Box) component, and as such, it inherits all the properties related to [Box](./Box).
