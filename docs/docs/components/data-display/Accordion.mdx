The `Accordion` component in Pearl UI is a versatile and customizable element used to display collapsible content panels for presenting information in a limited amount of space.

## Import

Pearl UI provides four components related to the Accordion functionality:

1. `Accordion`: This is the parent component that acts as a container for multiple `AccordionItem` components.
2. `AccordionItem`: This component represents a single collapsible content panel within the `Accordion`.
3. `AccordionButton`: This component controls the visibility of its corresponding `AccordionPanel`.
4. `AccordionPanel`: This component contains the content that is shown or hidden when the `AccordionButton` is clicked.

```jsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionButton,
  AccordionPanel,
} from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

        This is the content for the first section of the accordion. It can be
        replaced with any content you like.

### Accessing the internal state

If you need access to the internal state of each accordion item, you can use a render prop. It provides 2 internal state props: isExpanded and isDisabled.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionButton>
      <Text>Accordion Section 1</Text>
    </AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text>
        This is the content for the first section of the accordion. It can be
        replaced with any content you like.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    {(isExpanded) => (
      <>
        <AccordionButton
          bgColor={isExpanded ? "neutral.200" : undefined}
        >
          <Text>Accordion Section 2</Text>
        </AccordionButton>
        <AccordionPanel>
          <Text>
            This is the content for the second section of the accordion.
            It can be replaced with any content you like.
          </Text>
        </AccordionPanel>
      </>
    )}
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
