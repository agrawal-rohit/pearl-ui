The `useFocusedState` hook is a powerful utility in Pearl UI that not only manages a focused state but also transforms the `_focused` props into appropriate styles. This hook is instrumental in creating dynamic, responsive components that react to focus events with custom styles.

## Import

```js
import { useFocusedState } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Return value

The `useFocusedState` hook returns an object with three properties:

- `focused`: A boolean representing the current focused state. This is a local state which is useful in case the `parentStateValue` is not provided.
- `setFocused`: A function that can be used to set the `focused` state. This function updates the local state.
- `propsWithFocusedStyles`: The props object of the component with updated styles according to the current 'focused' state. This is achieved by using the `useDynamicStateStyle` hook internally, which manages a dynamic state and composes extra styling while a component is in a certain state.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use `useFocusedState` to manage a focused state and compose extra styling while an input field is focused:

```js
import { useFocusedState } from "pearl-ui";
import { useState } from "react";

const InputField = ({ isFocused, ...props }) => {
  // Use the hook to transform the props based on the focused state
  const { focused, setFocused, propsWithFocusedStyles } = useFocusedState(
    props,
    allStyleFunctions,
    "basic",
    false
    isFocused,
  );

  // Render the input field with the transformed props
  return <input {...propsWithFocusedStyles} />;
};

const App = () => {
  // Use a state variable to manage the focused state
  const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

  // Render the InputField and a toggle button to change the focused state
  return (
    <div>
      <InputField
        isFocused={isFocused}
        // Specify the styling of the component when the isFocused value is true
        _focused={{ borderColor: "blue", color: "black" }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => setIsFocused(!isFocused)}>
        Toggle Focused State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the provided example, the `useFocusedState` hook is utilized within an `InputField` component. The purpose of this hook is to dynamically alter the input field's border and text colors in response to changes in the `isFocused` prop. Specifically, when `isFocused` is set to true, the input field's border color transitions to blue, and the text color changes to black.
