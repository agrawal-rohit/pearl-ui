## Atoms and Molecules

Pearl UI follows the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) methodology which defines the practice of creating design systems in a bottom-up fashion to maintain an explicit order and hierarchy. There are five distinct stages of the _Atomic Design_ methodology, with the first three modelled after their equivalents in the Chemistry world. Each stage builds on the previous, acting as an aggregate of items from the preceding stages:

1. **Atoms** - The smallest building blocks in the system, eg. buttons, icons, inputs, labels, and other small elements that get used throughout a design.

2. **Molecules** - Atoms are combined in different ways to create unique molecules for use in a design, each with their own characteristics, style, and format.

3. **Organisms** - The organism is not yet a complete design, but is a component that can be reused across designs, or layout templates.

4. **Templates** - The template is the first stage of the Atomic Design methodology that does not align to a stage in the molecular world, but is important for Atomic Design. A template is where organisms and other elements are curated into a cohesive design.

5. **Pages** - This is where instances of templates are created. As data changes, different profile information, or languages may impact a template design. Building out to the page stage allows you to test for these variations and make adaptations globally to your templates.
