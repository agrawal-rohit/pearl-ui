## Author

Pearl UI was created by Rohit Agrawal. I started building Pearl UI in public to contribute to the community. The internet has been my source of education and inspiration for almost a decade now, and I feel fortunate enough to be in a position where I am able to give back and help people create something cool with code.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_rohitagrawal_) to stay up to date, and please [star the repo](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui) on Github.

_(**Note:** Pearl UI is a relatively new library, so there might be some bugs. I try to be very active in responding to [issues](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/issues) and in our [discussion forum](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/pearl-ui/discussions), so do let me know if you face any bugs or need to request any features.)_
