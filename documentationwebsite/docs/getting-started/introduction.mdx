## A Note from the Creator

Hey there! I'm Rohit Agrawal, the creator of Pearl UI. Thanks for checking out this project! While I do have a full-time startup, I ensure that every line of code in Pearl UI is written with care and precision. Open-source is a fantastic way to foster innovation and collaboration. I've learned so much from the internet and the developer community, and I'm excited to contribute to that collective knowledge with Pearl UI.
