# Box

Box is the most abstract component on top of which all other Pearl UI components are built. By default, it renders a `View` element.

**The Box component improves the development experience in the following ways:**

1. Create flexible layouts with ease.
2. Provides an easier way to pass styles via props (`backgroundColor` can be passed as a prop instead of using [React Stylesheet](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html) or inline styles). Shorthand props are also supported (`bg` instead of `backgroundColor`).
3. Create more complex components using `Box` as the base component, instead of `View` (All components in Pearl UI use `Box` under the hood).

## Import

```jsx
import { Box } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Box width="100%" height={200} backgroundColor="primary-500" marginBottom="m">
  This is a box
</Box>
```

## Example

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/box" />
