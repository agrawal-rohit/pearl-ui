The `Center` component is a layout utility in the Pearl UI library. It is designed to center its child elements both vertically and horizontally. By default, it renders a [Box](./box) element, which is a fundamental building block in Pearl UI.

## Import

```jsx
import { Center } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Center height={100} backgroundColor="neutral.300">
  This is the screen
</Center>
```

## Example

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/center" />

## Component Properties

### Supported Style Properties

The `Center` component composes the [Box](./Box) component, which means you can pass all the props that you would normally pass to a [Box](./Box) component.
