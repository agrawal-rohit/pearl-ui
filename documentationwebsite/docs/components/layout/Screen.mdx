The `Screen` component is a versatile layout tool designed to wrap all views in your application. It is built on top of the [Box](./box) element and implements a [React Native SafeAreaView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/safeareaview), ensuring that your content is always within the safe areas of the device. This is particularly useful for maintaining accessibility on devices with rounded corners or camera notches.

## Import

```jsx
import { Screen } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Screen>This is the screen</Screen>
```

### Scrolling Behaviour

If the content inside your screen exceeds the device height, the `Screen` component allows you to add scrolling support using the `scrollable` prop. By default, this prop is set to `true`.

```jsx
<Screen scrollable={true}>This is a scrollable screen</Screen>

<Screen scrollable={false}>This is a static screen</Screen>
```

### Pull to Refresh

:::caution
The Pull-to-Refresh functionality is not supported on web.
:::

The pull-to-refresh (or swipe-to-refresh) pattern lets a user pull down on a list of data using touch in order to retrieve more data. This can be added using the `onPullToRefresh` prop which expects a function/Promise to be executed when a pull-to-refresh action has occurred.

_(Note: The screen needs to be scrollable to allow this behaviour to work on iOS devices)_.

```tsx
<Screen
  onPullToRefresh={() => {
    new Promise<void>((res, rej) =>
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("I got executed!");
        res();
      }, 2000)
    );
  }}
>
  Pull me!
</Screen>
```

## Example Usage

Here are examples of the `Screen` component in both light and dark themes:

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/screen-light" />

## Component Properties

### Supported Style Properties

The `Screen` component is built upon the [Box](./Box) component, and as such, it inherits all the properties related to [Box](./Box).

### Additional Properties

In addition to the [Box](./Box) properties, the `Screen` component also integrates a [KeyboardAwareScrollView](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view), and supports all of its properties with the exception of:

- `refresh`
- `scrollEnabled`
- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`

The `Screen` component also supports the following additional properties:
