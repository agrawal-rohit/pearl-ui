The `Image` component can be used to display local or remote images. It also includes support built-in support for [image fallback](#image-fallback), [caching](#caching), and [progressive loading](#progressive-image-loading).

## Import

```jsx
import { Image } from "pearl-ui";
```

## Usage

```jsx
// Displaying a local image
<Image
  width={200}
  height={200}
  source={require("<path-to-local-image>.jpeg")}
/>

// Displaying an image from a remote source
<Image
  width={200}
  height={200}
  source={{
    uri: "https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1713248.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

### Aspect Ratio

In some cases, you might need to maintain the aspect ratio of an image to prevent cropping. You can easily do this by using the `aspectRatio` style prop.

```jsx
// Maintains aspect ratio for an image having fixed width
<Image
  width={200}
  aspectRatio={4/3}
  source={require("<path-to-local-image>.jpeg")}
/>

// Maintains aspect ratio for an image having relative width
<Image
  width="70%"
  aspectRatio={16/9}
  source={{
    uri: "https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1713248.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

### Caching

If your application deals with a lot of heavy images, it's a wise decision to cache these images locally to make them load faster. `Image` let's you cache your remote images easily with the help of the `isCached` prop. By default, this value is set to `true`.

```jsx
// The image is cached by default
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  source={{
    uri: "https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1713248.jpg",
  }}
/>

// Don't cache a particular image
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  isCached={false}
  source={{
    uri: "https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1713248.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

### Image loading indicators

While a remote image is being downloaded, a temporary placeholder that serves as a loading indicator provide can drastically improve your app's UX. You can choose among the following options to serve as loading indicators for your images:

#### Progressive image loading

![Progressive Loading Medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*JIph8aM2PyQb-o_RJhnmnQ.png)

[Progressive images](https://www.keycdn.com/support/progressive-images) loading displays as blurred low quality image that improves in resolution after the entire image is successfully fetched. This method is actively in popular apps like [Medium](https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/).

`Image` supports progressive loading of images with the use help of the `loaderType` and `previewSource` props. The `previewSource` is usually a low resolution version of the desired source image.

```jsx
// The loaderType prop specifies that this image needs to be loaded progressively
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  loaderType="progressive"
  source={{
    uri: "https://www.pixel4k.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-valley-minimal-4k_1596932776.jpg",
  }}
  previewSource={{
    uri: "<url-of-the-preview-image>",
  }}
/>
```

If you do not have a preview source image to work with, you can make use of the `previewColor` to emulate the progressive image loading behaviour used widely in [Google Image Search](https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en) as follows:

![Progressive Loading Google Images](https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*STsY5lfD4DA2wigfN76QpQ.png)

```jsx
// The loaderType prop specifies that this image needs to be loaded progressively
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  loaderType="progressive"
  source={{
    uri: "https://www.pixel4k.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-valley-minimal-4k_1596932776.jpg",
  }}
  previewColor="#934a9a"
/>
```

When both `previewSource` and `previewColor` props are specified, `previewSource` has a higher precedence.

#### Spinner loading

You could also add a good ol' [Spinner](../feedback/Spinner) while the image is loading by setting the value of the `loaderType` props to <t>"spinner"</t>. The visual styling of the spinner can be updated using the [default component config](#default-component-config).

```jsx
// The loaderType prop specifies that a spinner should be added while this image is being loaded
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  loaderType="spinner"
  source={{
    uri: "https://www.pixel4k.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-valley-minimal-4k_1596932776.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

### Image Fallback

Sometimes, the image you want to display doesn't exist or cannot be accessed due to network issues. In these cases, it is a good practice to show a replacement to the user as a fallback.

This is possible with the use of the `fallbackSource` and `fallbackComponent` props.

```jsx
// Displays an image saying 'No Image Available' in case the source image doesn't exist
<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  fallbackSource={{
    uri: "https://cdn.segmentnext.com/wp-content/themes/segmentnext/images/no-image-available.jpg",
  }}
  source={{
    uri: "https://4kwallpapers.com/imas/wallpapers/macos-big-sur-apple-layers-fluidic-colorful-wwdc-stock-2560x1440-1455.jpg",
  }}
/>;

// Displays a custom component with an error icon in case the source image doesn't exist
import { Icon } from "pearl-ui";

<Image
  width={100}
  height={100}
  fallbackComponent={
    <Icon
      iconFamily="MaterialIcons"
      iconName="error-outline"
      size="l"
      color="neutral.50"
    />
  }
  source={{
    uri: "https://4kwallpapers.com/imas/wallpapers/macos-big-sur-apple-layers-fluidic-colorful-wwdc-stock-2560x1440-1455.jpg",
  }}
/>;
```

If both the props are specified, the `fallbackComponent` prop takes higher precedence over `fallbackSource`.

### Override Style

The Image component also supports a [variety of style props](#supported-style-props) which can be used to override the pre-defined component style in the theme. Manual style props passed into the component have a higher precedance than the [default component config](#default-component-config).

```jsx
<Image
  mt="xl"
  boxShadow="xl"
  borderRadius="m"
  width="50%"
  height={200}
  source={{
    uri: "https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1713248.jpg",
  }}
/>
```

## Example

import Snack from "../../../src/components/ExpoSnack";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  defaultValue="light"
  values={[
    { label: 'Light', value: 'light', },
    { label: 'Dark', value: 'dark', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="light">

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/image-light" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="dark">

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/image-dark" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Accessibility

- Image has the `role` of `image`.

## Props

### Supported style props

Image composes the [Box](../layout/Box) component, you can pass all [Box](../layout/Box) props to `Image`.
