title: Color Mode (Dark Mode)

Pearl UI comes with built-in support for managing the active color mode in your apps. By default, most of the included components are dark mode compatible.

## Specifying the initial color mode

The color mode of your app on it's first load can be specified using the [ThemeProvider](../getting-started/setup#setting-up-the-theme-provider). It expects an `initialColorMode` prop which can take the following values:

1. **light**: The app would always start in _light_ mode
2. **dark**: The app would always start in _dark_ mode
3. **system**: The app would start with the mode corresponding to the color mode of the underlying device.

<br />

```jsx title="App.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

// Import the ThemeProvider component
import { ThemeProvider } from "pearl-ui";

const App = () => {
  return (
    // Wrap your app components with the ThemeProvider
    <ThemeProvider initialColorMode="system">
        // {... other components go here}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

## Accessing the active color mode

The active color mode can be accessed using the [useTheme](../hooks/useTheme) hook.

import Snack from "../../src/components/ExpoSnack";

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-access" />

## Changing the color mode

The [useTheme](../hooks/useTheme) hook comes back to the rescue! It exposes the following functions to change the active color mode.

### Toggling the active mode

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-toggle" />

### Switching to a specific mode

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-switch" />

## Color mode specific colors

To enable dark-mode compatibility for any component, you need to specify how the colors in the component change based on the active color mode. You can achieve this easily using the following 2 methods:

### Object syntax

The [color and background color](./style-props#color-and-background-color) style props optionally expect color mode specific values that get activated based on the active mode.

The following structure is expected when specifying color mode values:

```tsx
type ColorModeColor = {
  light: PearlTheme["palette"];
  dark: PearlTheme["palette"];
};
```

#### Example

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-object-syntax" />

### useColorModeValue

Pearl UI also provides the [useColorModeValue](../hooks/useColorModeValue) hook that achieves the same result as [the object syntax](#object-syntax).

Here's how you would re-write the example above using the [useColorModeValue](../hooks/useColorModeValue) hook:

#### Example

<Snack snackId="@agrawal-rohit/color-mode-hook-syntax" />
